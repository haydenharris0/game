A checkers game where you can pick different variants of the game that
you want to play. The rules will be provided for each variant of the game.
The variants that you will be able to pick are:
    - American Checkers(most likely the one you're familiar with)
    - Hexdame Checkers
    - International Checkers
    - Suicide Checkers

## Wireframes:

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS 
    - JavaScript
    - Jquery

## Approach: 
Start of by making the standard checkers game. Once I make all the logic for the
standard game, reuse as much logic as I can for the different variants of the game

## Challenges: 
Creating the logic for all the different games variants. 
Trying to reuse as much logic as I can between all the different variants.
